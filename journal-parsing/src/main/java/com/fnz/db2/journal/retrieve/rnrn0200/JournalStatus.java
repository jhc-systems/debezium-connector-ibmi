	1 	The journal receiver is currently attached to the journal.
	2 	The journal receiver is online. The journal receiver has not been saved, and it has been detached from the journal.
	3 	The journal receiver was saved after it was detached. The journal receiver storage was not freed when it was saved.
	4 	The journal receiver was saved after it was detached. The journal receiver storage was freed when it was saved.
	5 	The journal receiver status is partial for one of the following reasons: 
	    It was restored from a version that was saved while it was attached to the journal. Additional journal entries may have been written that were not restored.
	    It was one of a pair of dual journal receivers, and it was found damaged while attached to the journal. The journal receiver has since been detached. This journal receiver is considered partial because additional journal entries may have been written to the dual journal receiver.
	    It is associated with a remote journal and it does not contain all the journal entries that are in the corresponding journal receiver associated with the source journal.
6   The journal receiver status is empty, since the receiver has never been attached to a journal.
